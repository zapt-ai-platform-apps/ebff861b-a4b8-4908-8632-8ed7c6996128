Automatically post your new tweets to your connected Mastodon account.

## Steps

2. Post a new tweet on Twitter.
3. The app will automatically detect the new tweet and post it to your Mastodon account.
4. You can verify the post on your Mastodon account.

**Note:** The app checks for new tweets every 5 minutes. There may be a slight delay before the tweet appears on Mastodon.

**Important:** Only tweets posted after enabling cross-posting will be shared. Replies and retweets are excluded.
